            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny’s worth.</div> 
            <p class="quotes nowrap">“I was an EMT for many years before I
            joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have
            heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
            shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
            grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
            successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a
            VR startup.”

            Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
            easy.</div>
          <p class="quotes nowrap">“The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I
            find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary
            to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
            junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
            personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart

            <div class="review nowrap">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</div> <p class="quotes nowrap">“Before
            joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed
            some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming
            step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of
            theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The
            entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
            hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
            next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
            often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
            developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
            full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
            recommend!”
